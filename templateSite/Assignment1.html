        Hyper Text Markup Language is code used to create webpages. Yet the question is, how does it work and how do you write such code.    
        </p>

            <h3>Function of HTML</h3>
            <p>
                The function of Hyper Text Markup Language(HTML), is to set structure to the data shown in a webpage. 
                HTML structures data in many ways; one of the ways that HTML structures data is by allowing developers to organizes web pages in a way that makes sense for audience.
                Web developers can decide how to structure their webpages. Another function of structuring data with HTML is that it allows Search Engine Optimization(SEO), to understand your webpage better. 
                By following industry norms, SEO can scan headers and emphasize words. This allows them to understand what the webpage is about and conveys it to the audience through search engines like google.
                HTML structure also allows SEO to convey what the webpage is about to people who may be impaired, like people with impaired vision.</p>

            <h3>Writing HTML</h3>
            <p>
                HTML is written using 3 properties, elements, tags and attributes.
                Writing HTML starts with selecting the element that you want to use.
                An element is  a property that designates the structure of the content; which essentially defines what the content is displayed as, whether that's a list, a paragraph or heading.
                After you have chosen the element you must put that element in a tag.
                There are opening and closing tags and they are enclosed by <> or </> for closing tags; these tags set the border for where you put your content/text. 
                The last property used to write HTML is attributes. Attributes placed inside the opening tag and are used to provide extra information not included in the content/text in between tags. 
                The extra information they provide can come in many forms including links or images.            
             </p>
             <h3>HTML markup example</h3>
             <p>Here is an example of how HTML markup is written in code. 
                In this example the content "Shady Howe" is structured as a link using the a element. 
                The attribute then gives references where the link is coming from:  
             </p>

           <p>
            <a id = "Howe" href="http://shayhowe.com/">Shay Howe</a>
           </p>

        CSS is used to style and bring to life webpages. There are many functions to CSS; yet how does it work and how is it written.
        </p>

            <h3>Function of CSS</h3>
            <p>The function of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is to style the data shown on a webpage, to make it more appealing to the eyes.
                CSS allows developers to give their webpage style, whether that's a professional look, or artistic look.
                Styling a webpage also allows developers to make pages more legible; they can choose colors that complement instead of clash together. 
                Can also change the font and color of text so it can be more clear.</p>
    
            <h3>Writing CSS</h3>
            <p>
                CSS works by selecting specific parts of the HTML and defining how it acts or is styled.
                There are 3 properties used in CSS selectors, property and value. 
                CSS begins with the selector which selects an element in the HTML to be styled. 
                You write this as the element followed by curly braces { }. 
                After an element is selected the property determines which aspect of that element will be style, like color, font or width. 
                The property is followed by a colon which separates it from the value. 
                Value determines how the chosen property behaves; so if color is the property the value red determines that the selected text will behave/be red. 
                A value is followed by a semicolon, the property and value together are called a declaration. Below is an example of how CSS is structured:
            </p>

            <h3>CSS code example</h3>
            <p>
                Here is an example of how CSS is written in code. 
                In this example CSS uses the selector p, meaning that all elements p in the HTML are selected.
                The CSS then uses the color and font-size property to determine which aspect of the content selected will be affected.
                The value orange and 16px determine how the property behaves, meaning that the content selected will become orang and the font be 16 pixels:
            </p>
